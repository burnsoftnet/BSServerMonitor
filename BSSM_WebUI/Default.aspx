    Welcome to the Open-Source Server Monitor Project created by BurnSoft.net. This
    application was initially designed to monitor our internal servers, after designing
    it, we started to use it to monitor more then just servers. The flat client admin
    GUI will allow you to create your own types to categorize the device that you wish
    to monitor. Since this application just pings the device DNS name or IP Address
    it didn’t matter if it was a server or not so it’s really more of a network Device
    Monitor.

    <br />This web interface is currently a simple read only interface that will
    allow you to just view what all is listed, what is down and/or has errors. Check
    our <a href="http://www.burnsoft.net/Software_OpenSource.aspx?dir=BurnSoft_Server_Monitor">
        OpenSource</a> section for any updates.
