THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS WHAT WAS ADDED AND CHANGED SINCE VERSION 1.0 RELEASED IN SEPT. 2009.

 - Added Status ID 4, which means Slow Repsonse.
 - Changed Status ID 2 from "Changed/Warning" to "IP Changed"
 - Altered Views to reflect Status changes above.
 - Added table list_collectors_tempass, which will store the collectors Load list, when it is temporaliy transfered 
	from the current to the primer during an outage.
 - Adding comments to the code as it is accessed.
 - Added view view_collector_list
 - Modifed the Collector List window to pull data from the view_collector_list view instead of the list_collectors table.
 - Changed the Update Status on the BSSM_PingManager from updating only after it calls the DoList sub to after the do 
	list and if the collector is disabled.
 - Ability to Change the assigned Collector from the Device View
 - Add the abnility to add a collector
 - Add the view called Device List - Warnings Only
 - Added Event Logging to the Pinger for when a Server is up or Down.  If the Server was already up or already down, 
	it will not repeat the event alert.
 - Created and Application that uses NMAP to gather information such as Open Ports, and Trace details.  This information 
	is then saved in the database.
 - Added Daily statistic archiving of Pinf Results.  This will run once a day and Average out the Uptime of the Devices 
	that were pinged for that day per device.
 - Added the BSSM_NMAP Application to run with the BSSM Service.  This was designed to run once a Day to gather information.  
	Run time can be configured to run in the app.config file ( BSSM.exe.config )  Currently designed to run the data 
	collection at one time and process the data at another time, this is to givee enough time for the the 
	process to collect all the information.
 - Modified the pinger to write an event when the device is down and when it is back up.
 - Modified the pinger to ping the trace results from the device if a device is down.  This will only work if the UseTrace
	field in the device config is set to true.  Otherwise it will think that no data was collected for that device.
 - Modified the BSSM_NMAP application to only gather data for the devices that have the UseTrace and UsePort fields marked 
	ask 1 in the Database.
 - Added the BSSM_ColHealth process that will check the health of the collectors, if one of the collectors is not responding
	it will move the workload until the collector is back online.  It's work load will be marked in the list_collectors_tempass
	table.
 - Added the BSSM_ColHealth process to run with the BSSM Service, it will run at twice the interval of the ping process.  This
	was done just to make sure there is an issue with the collector and not that it is running late or slow.
 - Added The Ability to Take the load off the master server, buy clicking on a collector and have it move all devices from the master 
	to the select collector.
 - Added the Reports to allow you to print off the devices that are down, have warnings, disabled, deleted, and up and running.
 - Added additional function in the view collectors windows to help manage the collectors
 - Modified the View_DownOnly tag in the BSServerMonitor.exe.config , it acts more like a read only funtion that will allow the users
	to only see the devices via the UI but they are unable to do anything else, all the other administrative functions are disabled.
 - Changed the default timer for the Warnings and disabled views to run at startup instead of it being a manual process.
 - Added additional error catching.
 - Added the ability to mark a server as deleted from the addsvr command line tool - 12/11/2012
 - Added the ability to search for a device and list the sid from the addsvr command line tool. - 12/11/2012
 - While viewing a device details, you can hit the i key to display the server id number  - 12/11/2012
 - Added a /cleandb switch to the dbmaint.exe, put in the amount of days,months and year that you wish to keep the data and it will delete anything older then that.
 - Added the dbmaint.exe /cleandb to run everytime the regular db maintance runs
